# 1132 - Divisor Summation

**Description**

Given a natural number **n(1 <= n <= 5*10^5)**, please output the summation of all its proper divisors. Definition: A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number. For example, the number 20 has 5 proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and the divisor summation is: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22.

**Input specification**

An integer stating the number of test cases (equal to about 2*10^5 ), and that many lines follow, each containing one integer between 1 and 5*10^5 inclusive.

**Output specification**

One integer each line: the divisor summation of the integer given respectively.
